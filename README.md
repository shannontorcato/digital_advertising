## Business problem
We will analyze which users will respond to an offer for a service or product. Essentially we have to boost the profit of a marketing campaign

## Dataset
- [Kaggle Marketing Campaign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign)

## Methods

### Step 1:
We will be using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to query the database to understand what kind of data we are dealing with. We import the excel sheets (.xlsx) format into our workspace. We will be using the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard. 


 In addition we will get a better understanding of the contents while also cleaning and querying the dataset to extract revelant tables to excel. Thes tables will then be used to create visualization to help the stakeholders and clients to make a data-driven decision to their business or advertising campaign.
